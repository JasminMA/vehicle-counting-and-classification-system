# Vehicle Counting System - Client Overview

## What This System Does

This is an automated video analysis system that counts and classifies vehicles in your uploaded videos. Simply upload a video file through a web interface, and the system will automatically:

- **Count vehicles** by type (cars, trucks, motorcycles, buses, vans)
- **Track vehicles** throughout the video timeline
- **Generate reports** with detailed counts and timestamps
- **Provide downloadable results** in JSON and CSV formats

## How It Works (Simple Version)

1. **Upload**: Drag and drop your video file to the web interface
2. **Processing**: AI analyzes your video frame by frame (takes 1-5 minutes)
3. **Results**: View counts and download detailed reports
4. **Access**: Use any web browser - no software installation needed

## Example Results

For a 2-minute traffic video, you might get:
- **45 cars** detected
- **8 trucks** detected  
- **12 motorcycles** detected
- **2 buses** detected
- **Total: 67 vehicles**

Plus a timeline showing exactly when each vehicle appeared in the video.

## Cost Breakdown

### Monthly Base Costs (regardless of usage):
- **Infrastructure**: $6-8/month
- **Storage**: $2-3/month
- **Monitoring**: $1/month
- **Base Total**: ~$9-12/month

### Per-Video Processing Costs:
The main variable cost is **$0.10 per minute of video processed** by the AI.

#### Cost Examples:
| Video Length | Processing Cost | Total Monthly Cost* |
|--------------|----------------|-------------------|
| 1 minute     | $0.10         | $9.10 - $12.10   |
| 5 minutes    | $0.50         | $9.50 - $12.50   |
| 10 minutes   | $1.00         | $10.00 - $13.00  |
| 30 minutes   | $3.00         | $12.00 - $15.00  |

*Assuming 1 video per month. Multiple videos add $0.10 per minute processed.

### Real-World Usage Examples:

**Light Usage (1-2 videos/month, 5 minutes each):**
- Monthly cost: $10-13

**Moderate Usage (5-10 videos/month, 10 minutes average):**
- Monthly cost: $14-18

**Heavy Usage (20 videos/month, 15 minutes average):**
- Monthly cost: $39-42

## System Limitations

### Video Requirements:
- **Supported formats**: MP4, MOV, AVI
- **Maximum file size**: 8GB
- **Maximum video length**: 30 minutes
- **Recommended quality**: 720p or higher for best accuracy

### Accuracy Limitations:
- **Detection accuracy**: 85-95% (depends on video quality and conditions)
- **Best conditions**: Clear daylight, good resolution, vehicles clearly visible
- **Challenging conditions**: Night videos, heavy rain, very distant vehicles
- **Not perfect**: May occasionally miss vehicles or misclassify types

### Processing Limitations:
- **Processing time**: 1-5 minutes (depends on video length)
- **Not real-time**: Cannot process live video streams
- **Single video at a time**: Cannot process multiple videos simultaneously
- **Internet required**: Web-based system needs internet connection

### Technical Limitations:
- **HTTP only**: No HTTPS encryption (secure for single user, but no SSL)
- **Single user**: Designed for one person, not team collaboration
- **No video editing**: Cannot trim or modify videos within the system
- **No vehicle tracking between cameras**: Each video analyzed independently

## Factors That Affect Accuracy

### Good Results:
- ✅ Clear, high-resolution videos (720p+)
- ✅ Good lighting conditions
- ✅ Vehicles clearly separated
- ✅ Camera positioned to see full vehicles
- ✅ Stable camera (not shaky)

### Challenging Conditions:
- ⚠️ Night or low-light videos
- ⚠️ Heavy rain, snow, or fog
- ⚠️ Very distant vehicles (small in frame)
- ⚠️ Partially obscured vehicles
- ⚠️ Very crowded traffic (vehicles overlapping)

## How Video Length Affects Costs

### Processing Cost Formula:
**Cost = Video Length (minutes) × $0.10**

### Why Longer Videos Cost More:
- AI processes **every frame** of your video
- Longer videos = more frames = more processing
- A 30-minute video has **54,000 frames** vs. 1,800 frames for 1 minute

### Cost Optimization Tips:
1. **Trim videos** to focus on relevant sections before uploading
2. **Split long videos** into shorter segments if only parts need analysis
3. **Use representative samples** instead of analyzing entire long recordings
4. **Batch similar videos** together for easier cost tracking

### Example Cost Scenarios:

**Security Camera Analysis:**
- 24-hour recording trimmed to 10 minutes of activity
- Cost: $1.00 per analysis
- Monthly (daily analysis): ~$30

**Traffic Study:**
- 5 rush-hour periods, 15 minutes each
- Cost: $7.50 per week
- Monthly: ~$30

**Event Analysis:**
- Single 2-hour event
- Need to split into 4 × 30-minute segments
- Cost: $12.00 per event

## Getting Started

### What You Need:
1. **AWS Account**
2. **Video files** in MP4, MOV, or AVI format
3. **Web browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
4. **Credit card** for AWS billing

### Setup Process:
1. **System deployment** (1-2 hours technical setup)
2. **Test with sample video** (verify everything works)
3. **Training session** (15 minutes to show you how to use it)
4. **Go live** (start analyzing your videos)

### Ongoing Costs:
- **Predictable base cost**: $9-12/month regardless of usage
- **Variable processing**: $0.10 per minute of video
- **No surprise fees**: All costs are transparent and predictable

## Questions & Answers

**Q: Can I process multiple videos at once?**
A: No, the system processes one video at a time to keep costs low.

**Q: What if the AI makes mistakes?**
A: The system provides confidence scores. You can filter results by confidence level and manually review uncertain detections.

**Q: Can I cancel anytime?**
A: Yes, you can shut down the system anytime. You only pay for the months you use it.

**Q: What happens to my videos?**
A: Videos are automatically deleted after 30 days for privacy and cost savings.

**Q: Can I upgrade to handle more videos?**
A: Yes, we can modify the system to process multiple videos simultaneously if your needs grow.

**Q: Is my data secure?**
A: Videos are stored in your private AWS account. Only you have access to them.
